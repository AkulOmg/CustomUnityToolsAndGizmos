Custom Unity gizmos and tools Made in my second year of University.


The files in this verion of Unity gizmos and tools is a direct copy of all the code in the original project created in my second year at university for games Technology  course work. 
To allow the code to be readable online it had been copy/pasted to a Git hub repository/ new project
